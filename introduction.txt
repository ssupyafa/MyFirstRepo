Brief Introduction About Myself
Hello, my name is Yafet. I am from Ethiopia. I am currently a student. I’m passionate about how the emerging technologies works, and I enjoy learning new skills and improving myself every day.
In my free time, I like to code and develop new tools, and I’m always looking for opportunities to grow and improve my knowledge.
